# Maven-Hotel-Group_Excel-Project-2
## This project consists of Hotel booking data, from July 2015 to August 2017 provided in the course. I created a one-time explanatory dashboard that is meant to let the end users understand what is happening, why it's happening, and what actions they can take accordingly.

### Excel concepts covered are:- 
* Pivot Charts
* Partial Pivot Charts
* Conditional Number Formats
* Experiment with chart elements and layouts
* Usage of color and style strategically
* Formatting options
* Understanding & usage of a secondary axis
